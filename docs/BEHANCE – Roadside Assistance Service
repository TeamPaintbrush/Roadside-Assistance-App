## Project Overview

This project focuses on digitally transforming a traditionally non-digital roadside assistance service in India into a modern, user-centered mobile-first experience.

We identified major pain points:  
- Severe lack of real-time data & transparency  
- Slow response times & poor communication  
- Reliance on unstructured partner networks  
- Limited accessibility in smaller cities  

The solution is a seamless digital platform that streamlines booking, tracking, payments, and service delivery — improving satisfaction for users and operational efficiency for providers.

## DISCOVER Phase – Key Insights (India Context)

- **40%** of car owners in India have comprehensive insurance policies (many still lack roadside coverage)  
- **~120 million** people (≈8% of population) owned cars in 2022  
- **62.69%** of breakdowns caused by non-start issues (battery, fuel, etc.)  
- Roadside assistance market expected to grow at **~4.1% CAGR** (2022–2030 globally)

**Core Problem**  
Severe lack of structured data collection, real-time tracking, and easy digital access — leaving drivers vulnerable during breakdowns.
